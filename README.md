# Muta

The muta.io framework is targeted towards the rapid creation of simple flat websites with as few dependencies as possible. Our goal is providing maximum reusability through a combination of standardized data models, simple brand injection and the composition of modular web components. In other words, we are simply separating **data** from **branding** and **layouts**.
